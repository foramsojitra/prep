# Javascript

### Q : What is js?
A : JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language.

### Q : Difference between "var", "let" and "const"
A : var is there from the begining of the js, let and const introduced in ES6 all of this can be used for variable declaration. 
var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. 
var variables can be re-declared and updated : 
 ```javascript
      var a = 1;
      var a = 2; 
        OR
      var a = 1;
      a = 2;
--------------------
  function newFunction() {
  if(true){
          var a = "hello";
      }
  console.log(a);
  }
result will be => hello
--------------------
console.log(a);
      var a = 1;
 this code will interpreted as 
    var a;
    console.log(a); // a is undefined
    a = 1;
```

let has a block scope
```javascript
  function newFunction() {
  if(true){
          let a = "hello";
      }
  console.log(a);
  }
result will be => VM250:5 Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```
* var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
* var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
* They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
* While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

### Q : What are the different data types present in javascript?
A : There are two types of data types in JavaScript.
~~~
 1. Primitive data type
 2. Non-primitive (reference) data type
~~~

### Q : Difference between "==" and "===" 
A : == compares value and === compares vlue and type
== convert type of right side to type of left and then compare

### Q : Difference between null and undefined
A : both of them is an empty value but difference is that when you define a variable and not assign any value it automatically so you don't have to assign value undefine js do it for you. In case of null you have to assugn value null to variable. Typeof undefined will be undefined while typeof null will be object.

### Q : What is use of arrow 
A : arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
* Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.
* The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
* In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of this.
* In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.
* With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.
```javascript
let add = (x, y) => x + y;
--------------------------
let me = { 
 value: 1, 
 thisInArrow:() => { 
 console.log(this.value); // no 'this' binding here 
 }, 
 thisInRegular(){ 
 console.log(this.value); // 'this' binding works here 
 } 
};
me.thisInArrow(); 
me.thisInRegular();
==> result : undefined
             1
```
